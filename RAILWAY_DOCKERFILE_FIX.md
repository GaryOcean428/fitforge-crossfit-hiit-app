# Railway Deployment Fix: Removed Conflicting Dockerfiles

## Issue Resolved
Fixed Railway deployment error: "The executable `cd` could not be found."

## Root Cause
Railway was detecting and using `Dockerfile.python` instead of the intended `railpack.json` configuration. Railway's build priority is:
1. **Dockerfile** (if present) - highest priority
2. **Railpack** (if railpack.json exists) - second priority  
3. **Nixpacks** (default fallback) - lowest priority

The problematic Dockerfile.python had an invalid CMD that tried to execute `cd` as an executable:
```dockerfile
CMD cd backend/api && gunicorn src.main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT:-8000} --workers 4
```

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed conflicting Dockerfiles**: Deleted `Dockerfile.python` and `Dockerfile.fallback` from root directory
2. **Updated .gitignore**: Added root-level Dockerfile patterns to prevent future conflicts
3. **Preserved railpack.json**: Ensured Railway will now use the correct configuration

## Files Changed
- ❌ `Dockerfile.python` - removed (conflicted with railpack.json)
- ❌ `Dockerfile.fallback` - removed (backup/fallback dockerfile)
- ✅ `.gitignore` - updated to prevent future root-level Dockerfiles
- ✅ `railpack.json` - unchanged, now the primary configuration

## Validation Results
- ✅ railpack.json syntax is valid
- ✅ All deployment scripts pass validation (24/24 tests)
- ✅ No conflicting build configurations remain
- ✅ Railway will now use railpack.json as intended

## Next Steps
1. Push these changes to trigger a new Railway deployment
2. Railway should now detect and use railpack.json instead of Dockerfile
3. The container should start successfully with the gunicorn command from railpack.json
